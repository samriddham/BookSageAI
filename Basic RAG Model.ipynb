I will give you this son of mine in exchange for\\npart of that beast’s flesh.’\\n[16] On hearing those words, Dobun-mergen tore off one\\nof the deer’s hind-legs and gave it to the man. He then took\\nthe boy back to his yurt, where the boy worked as a servant.\\n[17] Not long afterwards, Dobun-mergen died.

Only the Ma’aliq\\nBaya’ud man lives in this yurt.

Again,\\nshe took five arrow-shafts96 and bound them together. She\\ngave the five bound shafts to each in turn, saying: ‘Break\\nthem.’ Each tried, but none succeeded.\\n94 Badonchar (or Bodonchar), ‘the Fool’ was probably born in\\n970; see Hua-sai and Dugarjab 1984, p. 271.\\n95 Literally, ‘third cousins (on the father’s side)’.

Whence did they come?” It is right for you to be\\nsuspicious.\\n[21] Every night, a shining yellow man came into the\\nyurt through the light of the smoke-hole and over the top of\\nthe door.

Alone, you can be\\nbroken easily by anyone. Together and of one mind, like\\nbound arrow-shafts, none can easily vanquish you.’ Not\\nlong afterwards, their mother Alan Qo’a passed away. \\n[23] After Alan Qo’a’s death, the five elder and younger\\nbrothers divided the livestock and property among\\nthemselves. Four of them—Belgününtei, Bügünütei, Buqu-\\nqatagi, and Buqatu-salji—each took a share. Only\\nBodonchar Mungqaq got no share, for they thought him\\nstupid and dull98 and therefore did not count him as their\\nkin.\\n96 Alan Qo’a's demonstration holds additional force in Mongol,\\nsince the word for an arrow-shaft (müsü) also means ‘a\\nstraight line’ and has moral overtones, like the English\\n‘straight’. Müsütei khün, for example, means ‘a man of\\nintegrity’. See Eldengtei et al. 1980, p. 231.

If I am to live, let me\\nlive.’100 And he gallopped off down the Onon River. On the\\nisland of Baljun, he built a grass yurt and lived there.\\n[25] While living in this way, he saw a young female\\nhawk catch and eat a black pheasant. Using the tail hairs\\nof his offwhite, mangy-tailed, sore-ridden horse with the\\nblack-striped back as a snare, he captured the hawk and\\nreared it.\\n[26] When he was without food, he would lie in wait and\\nkill wild beasts that wolves had cornered at the foot of the\\ncliffs and shoot and kill them. Together with the hawk, he\\nwould pick up and eat what the wolves had left behind. So\\nas the year passed, he nourished both his own gullet and\\nthe hawk’s.\\n[27] Spring arrived, bringing the ducks with it. He\\nstarved his hawk and flew it at them.

See also p. 42 n. 94.\\n99 Oroq means ‘off-white’; shingqula (shinggul) means ‘a dive or\\nswift penetration’. I translate these two words as ‘an off-\\nwhite, fleet-footed horse’. Section 55 has qurdun qubi,\\nmeaning ‘swift dun horse’. In both cases, shingqula and\\nqurdun qubi  are probably the names of the horses. For\\ndetails, see Choiji 1984, p. 33, n. 3.\\n100 Literally, ‘if die, its let die; if live, its let live’, i.e., ‘if (I) die, it\\n(is fate)’s (wish to) let (me) die’.

After flying his hawk, Bodonchar Mungqaq was\\nwont to visit them, drinking kumisss103 with them in the\\nday and returning to his grass yurt at night to sleep.\\n[29] These people asked for Bodonchar’s hawk, but he\\nrefused to give it to them. They failed to ask Bodonchar\\nwhose son he was and what tribe he belonged to. He, too,\\ndid not ask them what people they were. Yet he kept\\ncoming and going.\\n[30] His elder brother Buqu-qatagi, thinking that his\\nyounger brother Bodonchar had gone downstream along\\nthe Onon River, came searching for him. He asked these\\npeople moving down the Tünggelik Stream whether they\\nhad seen such a man with such a horse.\\n[31] They answered: ‘A man and a horse similar to those\\nthat you describe are here, together with a hawk. Every\\nday he comes to us, drinks kumisss, and goes away. It is\\nnot known where he spends the night. When the wind\\nrises in the northwest, the feathers and down of the ducks\\nand geese that his hawk catches scatter like snow and\\nblow across here. He cannot be far away. At around this\\ntime, he comes. Wait here for him.’\\n101 The words translated here as ‘bad odours’ and ‘dank smells’\\n(qonqshi’ut and höngshi’üt) literally mean ‘the bad smells of\\nburning fat and wild onions’. See Eldengtei et al. 1980, pp.\\n177, 198.\\n102 Direction was naturally important to the Mongols. The word\\ntranslated here as ‘rear’ (gerü) also means ‘northern side’,\\ni.e., the cold, sunless side, and the forests that grow on the\\nnorthern side of a mountain. Similarly, öbör means the ‘front\\nside’ or the ‘southern side’. For gerü, see Eldengtei et al.\\n1980, p. 203.\\n103 Literally, ‘eating a sour thing’. Kumiss (fermented mare’s\\nmilk) and the associated verb esükchilejü (used here) derive\\nfrom esük (ösög) meaning ‘sour’.

Again, they had no\\neffect; his elder brother remained silent. After travelling\\nfurther still, Bodonchar said the same words yet again.\\n‘What were you saying?’ his older brother asked.\\n[35] Bodonchar replied: ‘Those people camped along the\\nTünggelik do not distinguish between the great [lord] and\\nthe small [folk], between good and bad, between head and\\nhooves.105 Everyone is equal.

Bodonchar himself\\nwas sent galloping ahead, as scout. \\n[38] On the way, Bodonchar captured a woman, four to\\nfive months pregnant. 106 He asked her who she was.

The gist of Bodonchar’s utterance,\\nexplained more fully in Section 35, is that without a leader,\\nany group of people would remain incapable of organising its\\nown defence. There is also the implication that some form of\\nhierarchy is needed, under Bodonchar and his brothers.\\n105 Lord and commoners are meant by ‘head and hooves’.\\n48 THE SECRET HISTORY OF THE MONGOLS'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/the_secret_history_of_the_mongols_the_life_and_times_of_chinggis_khan1.pdf', 'page': 55, 'page_label': '49'}, page_content='[40] The woman with child went with Bodonchar and\\nbore a son who, as the son of a foreigner, was called\\nJajiradai.

The passage translated here as ‘a man of\\nthe Adangqa Uriangqad[ai] was constantly present in the\\nyurt’ has been taken by other translators, on the basis of the\\nword je (‘perhaps’) at the end of the statement, to indicate\\nthat the man in question was Jewüredei’s father. However,\\nthere is nothing to support this assertion, especially since\\nJewüredei could be excluded from the clan on account of his\\nmother’s status.

There are two explanations for\\nTaishi: that it derives (a) from the Chinese taizi, ‘prince’, or\\n‘crown prince’ (see Jagchid-Sechin 1979, p. 44, n. 3) and (b)\\nfrom the Chinese taishi, ‘great master’, an honorific title used\\nby northern nomadic peoples after the Liao Dynasty (see\\nDorontib 1979, p. 22, n. 22). The latter explanation is more\\nconvincing, given that the crown-prince system was not\\nestablished in Mongolia until after the enthronement of\\nChinggis Qahan. Taishi eventually became taiji, a general\\nterm in Mongol for male nobles. Yisügei derives from yisü(n),\\n‘nine’.

Ba’atur means ‘hero’.\\nOtchigin (as in Daritai-otchigin) is a compound of the Orkhon\\nTurkish word ot, ‘fire’, and chigin, a high-ranking official; it\\ntherefore means ‘guardian of the hearth’.

Being\\nthirsty, he dismounted [to join] their feast. The Tatars\\nrecognised him. ‘Yisügei-Kiyan has come,’ they said,\\nrecalling how he had once caused them insult by robbing\\nthem. Secretly wishing to harm him, they mixed poison\\n[into his food] and gave it to him.

The\\nreference is probably to Yisügei-ba’atur’s enemies (in which\\ncase, it was a well-founded fear on Temüjin’s part—see\\nSection 67) and a warning to Dei-sechen to watch carefully\\nover Temüjin.\\n154 Yellow Steppe.\\n155 This conversation happened in the year 1170.\\n156 Mönglik meant ‘mole’ (naevus) in Orkhon Turkish.
